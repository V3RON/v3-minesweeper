# 🚧 Work in progress

This repository is a playground for testing different approaches/libraries in action by implementing
a rather simple game in overcomplicated way.

In the future I plan to add:
* ✨ animations - to make it more eye-catching
* ⚡ multiplayer - versus mode (probably time based race) using Websocket
* 💥 music and sounds - well, silence is boring
